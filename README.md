Design and produce a Java program that simulates an ATM machine. 
You are required to implement and demonstrate an understanding of the following Java constructs within your program:
- Classes
- Methods
- Constructors
- Decision making
- collections
- Iteration
- Error handling

The following assumptions are to be taken into consideration when developing the program:
- Username and password (or PIN) are used instead of a bank card.
- Your program will contain a few users for testing.
- Users will have different account types (saving, current, business).
- Your program will run as a console application.
- Your program should consist of a few classes.
- The Main class should remain free from unnecessary code
